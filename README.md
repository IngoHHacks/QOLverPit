# QOLverPit
Small QOL features for CloverPit.

## Features

### Bulk Deposit
Deposit coins in larger increments than 5% of the current debt.  
Default keybinds to toggle the mode:
`Q` on keyboard, `Scroll Wheel Up/Down` on mouse, `Left Shoulder/Right Shoulder (Bumper)` on controller.  
There are four deposit modes: `Normal`, `Max`, `Max+` (disabled by default, enable in config or in-game settings), and `All`.
`Normal` deposits 5% of the current debt (like the base game).  
`Max` deposits the maximum multiple of 5%.
`Max+` deposits everything until 1 coin of debt is left. This is disabled by default because it's not possible with normal gameplay so it may be considered cheating.
`All` deposits everything possible.  
`Normal`, `Max`, and `Max+` inherit the base game behavior of leaving enough coins over to be able to pay for spins. `All` ignores this and will leave you with 0 coins if possible.

### Transition Speed Multiplier
The base game only allows you to go to 4x speed for transitions. This mod allows you to go up to 1000.  
The mod also has an option to change the game speed. Be careful with this, as it may cause physics issues and other bugs.

### Auto-Skip Splash Screens
Skips the intro logos on startup. 
Disabled by default, enable in config or in-game settings.

### You can now quit the game from the start screen

## Fun Fact
The name "QOLverPit" is a portmanteau of "QOL" (Quality of Life) and "CloverPit".
Really creative, I know. Sometimes I amaze even myself.

## Why did you name it QOLverPit? That's so cringe. It's not even a good pun.
Deal with it.

Let's go gambling! üçÄ
